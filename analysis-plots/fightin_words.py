    Arguments:
    - l1, l2; a list of strings from each language sample
    - ngram; an int describing up to what n gram you want to consider (1 is unigrams,
    2 is bigrams + unigrams, etc). Ignored if a custom CountVectorizer is passed.
    - prior; either a float describing a uniform prior, or a vector describing a prior
    over vocabulary items. If you're using a predefined vocabulary, make sure to specify that
    when you make your CountVectorizer object.
    - cv; a sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer object, if desired.
